    This paper examines the performance of U.S.~bank holding companies
    before, during, and after the 2007--2012 financial crisis.
    Fully nonparametric methods are used to estimate technical, cost,
    and input-allocative efficiencies.
    Recently-developed statistical results are used to test
    for changes in efficiencies as well as productivity over time, and
    to test for changes in technology over time.
    I find evidence of non-convexity of banks' production set is found.  In
    addition, the data reveal that
    mean technical efficiency declined during the financial crisis, but
    recovered in the years after, ending higher in 2016 than in 2006,
    while both cost and input allocative efficiencies declined from 2006 to
    2016.  Statistical tests indicate that technology shifted downward
    throughout the period 2006--2016.

   This paper examines the performance of Chinese commercial banks before, during, and after the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2008--2010 China's 4 trillion Renminbi stimulus plan. Fully nonparametric methods are used to estimate technical efficiencies. Recently-developed statistical results are used to test for changes in efficiencies as well as productivity over time, and to test for changes in technology over time. We also test for differences in efficiency and productivity between big and small banks, and between domestic and foreign banks. We find evidence of the non-convexity of banks' production set. The data reveal that technical efficiency declined at the start of the global financial crisis (2007--2008) and after the China's stimulus plan (2010--2011), but recovered in the years later (2011--2013), and declined again from 2013 to 2014, ending lower in 2014 than in 2007. We find that productivity declined during and just after the China's stimulus plan (2009--2011), but recovered in the years later (2013--2014), ending lower in 2014 than in 2007. We also find that the technology shifted downward from 2012 to 2013, and then shifted upward from 2013 to 2014. Over the period 2007--2014, technology shifted upward. We provide evidence that in general big banks were more efficient and productive than small banks. Finally, foreign banks had higher efficiency and productivity than domestic banks only in 2008.
